# Shooting-game
I had an idea of making a game like this so i made it come true.This game includes different themes for the character,more difficult waves,10 lives and etc...

# Tasks
Your task is to kill the enemies that are coming from the top of the screen and don't let them to escape otherwise you're gonna lose a live.The character has an orange
weapon and it shoots to the coordinates of the cursor which means that if you want to kill the enemies you have to keep your cursor on the center of the enemies.

# Controls
You are only able to move in the X axis so it means that you can use the A and D button to go to the left and right.
